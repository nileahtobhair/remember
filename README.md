# Remember FE

Bootstrapped with create-react-app. React front-end for the remember app, an app to store and get notified of all your important dates.

## Roadmap

1. Error boundary + simple 404 page - simple 404 page with simple link back to home
2. Add time input to date creation
3. Timezone handling - allow user to select timezone when creating event. show event in local timezone when viewing single event (with indication to user that it is single event).
4. CRUD functionality for calendars.
5. Basic hook up to api.
6. register + signin functionality.
7. Improve recurring events handling.

## Scripts

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
